        <p>Welcome to Show Analyzer.<br>
            Here you can check the rating trend of a TV show, visualize how
            well (or not well) it's been doing since it's release, which was the best season,
            best episodes etc etc.<br>
            So keep calm, and look up your favourite show!</p>
